LONG_DESCRIPTION = r'''
*CDPKit* (short for Chemical Data Processing Toolkit) is an open-source cheminformatics toolkit written in C++.

CDPKit comprises a set of software tools and a programming library called the *Chemical Data Processing Library* (CDPL).
The CDPL provides a high-quality and well-tested modular implementation of basic functionality typically required by any
higher-level cheminformatics software application.

In addition to the CDPL C++ API, an equivalent Python-interfacing layer is provided that allows to harness all of CDPL's
functionality easily from Python code.
This PyPI project hosts source and pre-built binary packages (wheels) for a comfortable installation of the CDPL Python bindings on
Linux, macOS and Windows via the **pip** command.

For more information about CDPKit and the CDPL please visit https://cdpkit.org.
