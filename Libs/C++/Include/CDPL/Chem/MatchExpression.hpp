         * \brief A generic boolean expression interface for the implementation of query/target object equivalence tests
         *        in molecular graph matching algorithms.
         *
         * The \c %MatchExpression interface abstracts the task of checking a set of constraints on the attributes of target
         * objects when performing query object equivalence tests in molecular graph matching procedures.
         * Subclasses of \c %MatchExpression must override one (or all, if required) of the provided function call operators
         * to implement the logic of the constraint checks. The first form of the two operators gets called in the pre-mapping stage
         * of the graph matching algorithm where all feasible query/target object pairings are determined. In this pre-mapping
         * stage all sorts of query constraints can be checked that are invariant with respect to the final mapping between
         * any of the other query and target objects. 
         * The second type of operator is invoked immediately after a complete graph mapping solution has been found and can
         * be used to re-evaluate the validity of a given query/target object pairing in the context of the provided matching
         * result. As soon as a pairing is found to be invalid, the current mapping solution is rejected and the algorithm proceeds
         * to find the next possible query to target graph mapping (if any).
         * For efficiency reasons, subclasses of \c %MatchExpression which implement the post-mapping function call operator must
         * explicitly enable its invocation by additionally overriding the MatchExpression::requiresAtomBondMapping() method. Its
         * implementation simply has to return \c true (the default implementation returns \c false) to request the invocation of
         * the operator. 
         *
         * \tparam ObjType1 The type of the primary query/target objects for which the expression gets evaluated.
         * \tparam ObjType2 The type of secondary query/target objects which provide auxiliary information for
         *                  expression evaluation.
