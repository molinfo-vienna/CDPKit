         * \brief An interface for writing data objects of a given type to an arbitrary data sink.
         *
         * \c %DataWriter is the common interface of classes which write objects of a given type 
         * (specified by the template parameter \a T) to some data sink (e.g. a file) that expects
         * the data to be encoded in a particular storage format.
         *
         * From the \c %DataWriter interface point of view, the data sink is continuous output stream
         * in which the data objects are written as data records. For the output of a given data object
         * the method write() has to be called with the object passed as an argument. 
         *         
         * If the write() operation fails, the writer instance is set into an error state that can be
         * queried by the operators operator const void*() and bool operator!(). Additionally, a 
         * \c %DataWriter implementation may decide to throw an exception of type Base::IOError to
         * report the error condition.
         * 
         * \tparam T The type of the written data objects.
