         * Subclasses of \c %View2D implement the generation of two-dimensional visual representations of data objects
         * with a given type. According to the <em>Model-View-Controller</em> [\ref WMVC] concept, a \c %View2D instance
         * thus plays the role of the \e View for a \e Model represented by the visualized data object. The rendering of a model's
         * visual represention on a given target device is performed by the render() method, which uses a passed Vis::Renderer2DRenderer2D
         * instance for drawing the graphical primitives constituting the overall depiction. The behaviour of a \c %View2D
         * instance can be configured using control-parameters and properties (if the type of the data object is a direct or indirect
         * subclass of Base::PropertyContainer). Control-parameters can be modified and queried using the methods provided by 
         * Base::ControlParameterContainer which is a public base class of \c %View2D.
