         * \brief An interface class with methods that provide information about the metrics of a font.
         *
         * Implementations of the \c %FontMetrics interface provide height and width information for a
         * given font and specific character glyphs in that font. Once a font has been specified with setFont(),
         * there are several methods that operate on the font.
         *
         * The methods
         *   - getAscent()
         *   - getDescent()
         *   - getHeight()
         *   - and getLeading()
         *
         * return basic size properties of the font. The ascent is the maximum amount by which characters ascend
         * \e above the baseline, and the descent is the maximum amount by which characters descend \e below the
         * baseline. The leading, or interline spacing, is the logical amount of space to be reserved between the
         * descent of one line of text and the ascent of the next line. The height metric is the sum of the ascent
         * and descent plus some implementation dependent extra space.
         *
         * For single characters or strings, the advance width can be obtained by getWidth(). The advance width
         * specifies the distance to a position on the baseline where the next character(s) should be drawn.
         * A bounding rectangle large enough to contain the rendered glyph of a character, or a set of glyphs for
         * a string, can be retrieved by getBounds().
