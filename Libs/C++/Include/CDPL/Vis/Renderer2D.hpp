        /**
         * \brief An interface that provides methods for low level 2D drawing operations.
         *
         * For the drawing of graphical primitives the following methods are provided:
         *  - drawPoint() for drawing points
         *  - drawLine() for drawing single line segments
         *  - drawPolyline() for drawing connected line segments
         *  - drawLineSegments() for drawing a set of disjoint line segments
         *  - drawPolygon() for drawing polygons
         *  - drawRectangle() for drawing axis aligned rectangles
         *  - drawPath() for drawing arbitrary shapes
         *  - and drawText() for drawing text
         *
         * Drawing operations can be clipped to arbitrary shapes defined by a Vis::Path2D object. A new clip region is set
         * by calling the method setClipPath() and disabled by calling clearClipPath().
         *
         * Coordinates of points that define the geometry of graphical primitives are normally directly mapped to the coordinate
         * system of the drawing device (e.g. an off-screen image buffer). This 1:1 mapping can be changed by applying
         * affine transformations to the input coordinates. 
         *
         * Affine coordinate transformations can be specified by calling the methods:
         *  - setTransform()
         *  - and transform()
         *
         * The former method replaces the current transformation matrix by a matrix that was provided as argument. When the latter
         * method is called, the current matrix gets multiplied with the argument matrix to produce a combined affine transformation.
         * To restore the 1:1 coordinate mapping, call setTransform() with a default constructed Math::AffineTransform3D instance.
         *
         * The style and color of lines and shape outlines is defined by the current pen which is specified by setPen(). 
         * The current pen also defines the color of rendered text and the color and diameter of points. The fill pattern
         * and fill color of shapes (rectangles and polygons) is defined by the current brush which is specified by setBrush().
         *
         * The current state of the renderer (brush, pen, font and transformation matrix) may be saved by saveState()
         * and restored by restoreState().
