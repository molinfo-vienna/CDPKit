         * \brief A smart pointer managing the lifetime of allocated \e Cairo data structures.
         *
         * Data structures required for interfacing with the <em>Cairo 2D Graphics Library</em> [\ref CAIRO] 
         * generally have to be allocated dynamically via specialized functions and are passed as pointers
         * from and to the \e Cairo library. The lifetime of an allocated data structure is determined by its
         * reference count which has to be managed explicitely by the client code. \c %CairoPointer automatizes
         * the reference count management by incrementing the reference count of the wrapped object whenever a
         * \c %CairoPointer instance is copied, and decrementing the reference count if the \c %CairoPointer is
         * destroyed or gets overwritten by assignment of another pointer instance of the same type. 
         *
         * Since the \e Cairo library is written in C and functions for changing the reference count of different
         * \e Cairo data structures are named differently, \c %CairoPointer relies on the traits class \c CairoPointerTraits<T>
         * which has to be specialized for a particular data type and performs the actual work of incrementing
         * and decrementing the reference count by calling the appropriate functions. Note that only a \e Cairo data structure
         * for which such a specialization exists can be managed by a \c %CairoPointer. An attempt to instantiate \c %CairoPointer
         * with an unsupported type will result in a compile time error.
         *
         * Currently specializations for the following types are provided:
         *   - \c cairo_t
         *   - \c cairo_surface_t
         *   - \c cairo_pattern_t
         *
         * \tparam T The type of the managed \e Cairo data structure.
