master:

 - Support for fully customizable atom and bond labels in 2D structure depictions

V1.1.1:

 - Significantly improved the generation of 2D coordinates for macrocyclic structures
 - Fixed an issue with the generation of conformers under application of a fixed substructure template where the generated
   conformers sometimes displayed the mirror image of the specified 3D template structure
 - The command line tools 'structgen' and 'confgen' erroneously used the already reserved letter 'p' as shortcut for
   the option '--fixed-substr-min-atoms'. The new shortcut is '~'
 - Support for Python version 3.12 in Manylinux2014-based pip package builds
 - Rewrote code that uses the boost filesystem library to use C++17 equivalents (conditional, only if a proper std::filesystem
   implementation is available)
 - Compiling CDPKit now requires a compiler with C++17 support

V1.1.0:
 - The tool 'tautgen' provides two new tautomer generation modes BEST_SCORING and BEST_SCORING_UNIQUE
   (the new default mode) for generating only the chemically most reasonable tautomers
 - New getter/setter method pair in class Chem::TautomerGenerator that allows to suppress the output of generated tautomers
   which represent just a different resonance structure of a previously reported tautomeric form
 - Overhaul of the tautomer generation code for increased efficiency and flexibility
 - Documentation updates and corrections
 - Versatile new Python example script for database preparation
 - New Python example script demonstrating how the torsion driving functionality can be used for conformer sampling
 - Fixed bugs in classes Chem::MaxCommonAtomSubstructureSearch and Chem::MaxCommonBondSubstructureSearch that led to a
   loss of expected matches
 - The visual molecule and reaction data inspection tool 'ChOX' now allows to display atom and bond configuration labels
 - The 2D molecule structure rendering code (implemented by class Vis::StructureView2D) now
   allows to display atom and bond configuration labels
 - Full implementation of the CIP sequence rule stack for the correct labeling of atom and bond stereocenters
 - New 3D structure generator feature that allows to enforce a particular 3D structure for defined parts of the input molecules
 - New conformer generator feature that allows to specify substructures of the input molecules that
   shall adopt a particular conformation which is then kept 'fixed' during conformer generation
 - Renamed all ForceField::MMFF94XXXInteractionData data structures into ForceField::MMFF94XXXInteractionList
   (XXX = force field interaction type)
 - New class ForceField::ElasticPotential plus elastic potential energy and gradient calculation functions
 - Conformer generator settings now allow to specify rotatable bond count dependent values for RMSD threshold, energy window and
   max. output ensemble size
 - The output conformer ensemble compilation process now strives for higher energetic diversity among the picked conformers which, on average,
   leads to higher accuracy in the reproduction of experimental structures
 - Update of the torsion library used for systematic conformer generation
 - The pharmacophore screening application 'psdscreen' provides a new option '--unique-hits'
   which enforces that a database molecule matched by multiple query pharmacophores is saved only once to the output hit list
 - Fix for a bug in the SMARTS parser that lead to the storage of wrong bond directions
 - Bond direction specifications (up/down) in SMILES and SMARTS strings are now correctly interpreted
 - Support for reading/writing molecular structures in XYZ format 
 - Systematic conformer sampling speed optimizations
 - Reduction of the memory footprint of the conformer generation procedure which could become unacceptably large
   under some circumstances
 - Fixed a bug that may lead to the generation of conformers with wrong geometries at exocyclic double bonds
 - Refactoring of stereochemistry related code
 - New command line application 'isogen' for the enumeration of R/S and E/Z stereoisomers of molecules
 - New class (Chem::StereoisomerGenerator) for the exhaustive enumeration of R/S and E/Z stereoisomers
 - New 2D drawing primitives (Vis::Path2D and Vis::PathPrimitive2D) and support for clipping operations
   (class Vis::ClipPathPrimitive2D)
 - Fixed a bug in the 'shapescreen' tool that lead to the calculation of erroneous similarity scores
   when option '--score-only' was specified
 - Fix for a minor bug that affected the indentation of SD-file property entries
 - New class (Chem::BemisMurckoAnalyzer) for the extraction of Bemis-Murcko scaffolds
 - New CDPL::Chem functions for the alignment of conformers
 - Function overload resolution order fixes in the CDPL.Math Python package
 - Prevented the throwing of exceptions when the env. variable LC_ALL has not been initialized
 - Python exports of Util::Map and Util::MultiMap do not provide the properties 'keys', 'values', and 'entries' anymore.
   They were replaced by the corresponding methods keys(), values() and items()
 - MolProp::getAtomCount() function has been extended by a 'strict' argument which, if set to 'false', instructs
   the accounting procedure to regard the meaning of generic atom types (e.g. any halogen)
 - New utility functions Chem::calcBasicProperties() enabling a more comfortable initialization of Chem::MolecularGraph
   and Chem::Reaction instances for further processing
 - CDPL Python bindings code cleanup
 - CDPL API cleanup
 - When deep copying Chem::Reaction or Chem::Molecule instances, values of properties referencing atoms and/or bonds (e.g. stereodescriptors, SSSR)
   now get automatically translated to values referencing the corresponding atoms/bonds of the copying target
 - The calculation of GRAIL descriptors (classes GRAIL::GRAIL(X)DescriptorCalculator) now only considers heavy atoms which do not represent
   a complementary feature type in the calculation of environment HBA/HBD occupation scores 
 - Class GRAIL::GRAILDescriptorCalculator now calculates a shorter descriptor (35 elements) with
   not further subdivided H-bond donor/acceptor feature types
 - Class GRAIL::GRAILDescriptorCalculator renamed into GRAILXDescriptorCalculator
