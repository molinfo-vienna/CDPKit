   match expression functions employed for substructure matching will be retrieved (default: use the expressions provided as properties)
 - Renamed functions Biomol::*PDBIgnoreConectRecordsParameter() into Biomol::*PDBIgnoreCONECTRecordsParameter()
 - Fixed methods write() and writelines() of class Base.IOStream() which both failed when being called with an argument of
   type str or sequences thereof
 - New method getbytes() of class Base.StringIOStream() that allows to retrieve written data
   as Python bytes object

   perceived functional groups (see below)
 - New class MolProp::FunctionalGroupList plus convencience functions MolProp::perceiveFunctionalGroups()
   that identify and extract functional group substructures of a molecular graph via the algorithm developed by P. Ertl.
   Core atoms/bonds of detected functional groups are made available as a list of Chem::Fragment objects. The name property
   (accessible via function Chem::getName()) of each func. group fragment then provides the generalized form of the
   functional group as a canonical SMILES string
 - New control-parameter Chem::SMILES_OUTPUT_HYDROGEN_COUNT (plus associated functions) allowing to control whether implicit
   hydrogen count specifications for atoms in brackets shall be written on SMILES output (default: yes)
 - SMILES reading/writing code has been extended to support atoms with the novel type Chem::AtomType::R
 - New atom type constant Chem::AtomType::R for the specification of atoms representing R-groups
 - New option --conj-ring-bond-pattern of command line tool 'TautGen' for enabling (=default)/disabling the new
   conj. ring bond order flipping tautomerization rule (see below)
 - Significant improvement of the tautomer scoring function with focus on the evaluation of hydroxy-pyridine
   containing and highly conjugated molecule tautomers 
 - The command line tool 'TautGen' provides two new options -r and -R that allow control whether input 2D or 3D
   atom coordinates shall be retained (might lead to distorted and/or invalid 2D/3D structures) or removed (default)
   from the generated tautomers
 - The command line tool 'TautGen' now removes all for the sake of processing added explicit hydrogens from the
   generated tautomers before output
 - Added new tautomerization rule id Chem::TautomerizationType::CONJ_RING_BOND_SWITCH

   or as a copy of a provided Chem::MolecularGraph instance). The substructure search and optional exclude pattern(s)
   are specified by SMARTS strings. Multiple search/exclude patterns can be specified as whitespace separated lists
   of the respective patterns. The editing result pattern is provided as a SMILES string (with extensions implemented
   especially for substructure editing)
 - New class Chem::SubstructureEditor for editing the atoms and/or bonds of molecular graph substructures according to
   a specified target substructure template

   Base::DataOutputHandler<T>::createWriter(std::ostream&) in order to support write-only output streams
 - Fixed an issue with the command line tool 'PSDScreen' where the default value of option -u
   was not properly set at program startup. In screening mode 'ALL-MATCHES', multiple program executions
   using the same input files might thus have led to varying number of reported hits 
 - The screening hit rate reported by command line tool 'PSDScreen' now always specifies the number of
   matched unique database molecules in relation to the total amount of screened molecules -
   irrespective of the number of query pharmacophores and screening mode (-m option)
 - Fixed an issue with spiro ring systems in the implementation of the 'extended smallest set of smallest rings'
   perception algorithm
 - C++ standard input, output and error streams (std::cin, std::cout and std::cerr) are now exposed
   as class variables Base.IStream.STD_IN, Base.OStream.STD_OUT and Base.OStream.STD_ERR, respectively
   For example, Base.IStream.STD_IN might be passed as argument to the constructor of a Chem.MoleculeReader
   instance which will then read molecule data from the standard input of the current process

   that allows to control whether any indices (mol. index, conf. index, etc.) stored to mol. SD entries shall be zero- or one-based
 - The command line tool 'PSDScreen' now offers a new option -r that allows to specify a report file in which
   sceening hit information gets written as lines of tab-separated values (without any mol. structure data).
   The new option can be used in additon or instead of option -o which, as before, specifies an output file for saving
   structural hit molecule data
 - Reduction of RAM consumption when querying pharmacophore feature count data stored in PSD files
 - Reduction of pharmacophore screening database (PSD) file sizes by ~55% due to the introduction of more compact

   exception which was thrown when exceeding the set time limit without having generated a set of 3D atom coordinates

   is now more correct and ~100 times faster than the previous one

   destination file for a new database to be created by the program 'PSDCreate' is now
   completely freed and not just internally marked as unallocated space

   duplicate features (that should be removed) to be retained instead of the non-duplicated ones
 - Sphinx documentation updates

V1.2.0:

 - Added new setter/getter method pair groupReferenceFeatures()/referenceFeaturesGrouped() to class Pharm::PharmacophoreFitScore for controlling

   manipulation of pharmacophore data
 - Fixed an issue concerning the calculation of pharmacophore fit scores that previously also considered mappings
   of multiple query features to the same target feature. Now, more correctly, the best score that could be calculated
   for all possible one-to-one feature mappings is reported.
