# \brief Calculates the <em>Hamming Distance</em> [\ref WHAM, \ref CITB] between the bitsets <em>bs1</em> and <em>bs2</em>.

# The <em>Hamming Distance</em> \f$ D_{ab} \f$ is calculated by:

# \[ D_{ab} = N_a + N_b \]

# where \f$ N_a \f$ is the number of bits that are set in the first bitset but not in the second bitset and \f$ N_b \f$ is the number of bits that are set in the second bitset but not in the first one.
# 
# If the specified bitsets <em>bs1</em> and <em>bs2</em> are of different size, missing bits at the end of the smaller bitset are assumed to be zero.
# 
# \param bs1 The first bitset.
