.getObjectID
\brief Returns the numeric identifier (ID) of the wrapped C++ class instance.
\param @A0@ The \e %@CN@ instance this method is called upon.

Different Python \e %@CN@ instances may reference the same underlying C++ class instance. The commonly used Python expression
<tt>a is not b</tt> thus cannot tell reliably whether the two \e %@CN@ instances \e a and \e b reference different C++ objects. 
The numeric identifier returned by this method allows to correctly implement such an identity test via the simple expression
<tt>a.getObjectID() != b.getObjectID()</tt>.

\return The numeric ID of the internally referenced C++ class instance.
