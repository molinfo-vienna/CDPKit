    "\n",
    "Dynamic Properties\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The *CDPL* stores properties associated with certain types of data like molecules, atoms, bonds, pharmacophores, etc. not as ordinary data members of the implementing classes\n",
    "but as *key:value* pairs in a dictionary (similar to the `__dict__`_ attribute of Python objects). This design decision was made due to several advantages of this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Flexibility and extensibility: new properties can be defined at runtime by user code\n",
    "* Class instance specific property values can be stored directly in the dictionary of the instance they are\n",
    "  associated with, no external accompanying data structures are required for storing user-defined properties\n",
    "  unknown to the *CDPL*\n",
    "* It can be easily determined whether the value of a particular property is available or not by checking if\n",
    "  the dictionary contains a corresponding entry. C++ class data members (note that *CDPL* Python objects just wrap\n",
    "  corresponding C++ class instances!) exist in memory after a class instance has been constructed and from that\n",
    "  point on have a value. This is particularly problematic for properties that cannot be assigned a reasonable\n",
    "  default value.\n",
    "\n",
    "All *CDPL* classes supporting this kind of dynamic property storage are derived from class \n",
    "`CDPL.Base.PropertyContainer`_ which provides methods for property value lookup, storage, removal, iteration, existence testing and counting. Properties are identified by unique keys of type `CDPL.Base.LookupKey`_ \n",
    "that are created on-the-fly during the *CDPL* initialization phase. Keys of pre-defined *CDPL* properties are exported as static attributes of classes that follow the naming scheme *CDPL.<PN>.<CN>Property*. \n",
    "*<PN>* denotes the *CDPL* sub-package name (see table above) and *<CN>* is the name of a child class of `CDPL.Base.PropertyContainer`_ for which these properties have been defined (example: atom property keys \n",
    "accessible via class `CDPL.Chem.AtomProperty`_). Property values virtually can be of any type and get stored in \n",
    "the dictionary as instances of the data wrapper class `CDPL.Base.Any`_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since `CDPL.Base.PropertyContainer`_ methods acting upon a particular property always demand the key of the property as argument and setter/getter methods in addition require knowledge of the value type, corresponding code\n",
    "is not only tedious to write but also hard to read and error prone. Therefore, each *CDPL* sub-package that introduces properties also provides four free functions (at package level) per property that encapsulate the \n",
    "low-level `CDPL.Base.PropertyContainer`_ method calls. These functions internally not only specify the correct property key and value type but also constrain the type of the `CDPL.Base.PropertyContainer`_  \n",
    "subclass the property has been introduced for. `CDPL.Chem.getOrder()`_, `CDPL.Chem.setOrder()`_, `CDPL.Chem.hasOrder()`_ and `CDPL.Chem.clearOrder()`_ represent an example of such four functions that are provided\n",
    "for the property `CDPL.Chem.BondProperty.ORDER`_ of `CDPL.Chem.Bond`_ instances using integer as value type.\n",
    "Using property getter functions (like `CDPL.Chem.getOrder()`_) has the additional benefit that they will, if one \n",
    "has been defined, automatically return a default value for unset properties. Defined property default values are exported and accessible as static attributes of classes that follow the naming scheme \n",
    "*CDPL.<PN>.<CN>PropertyDefault* (example: `CDPL.Chem.BondPropertyDefault`_; for the meaning of *<PN>* and *<CN>* \n",
    "see text above). \n",
    "\n",
    "Control-Parameters\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Control-parameters are used for the runtime configuration of arbitrary functionality in a generic, flexible and functionality independent way (in the *CDPL* mainly used by the data I/O and visualization code).\n",
    "The implementation and usage of the control-parameter infrastructure largely parallels the one for dynamic properties: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Control-parameters are identified via unique instances of class `CDPL.Base.LookupKey`_ \n",
    "* Values can be of any type and are stored in a dictionary as `CDPL.Base.Any`_ objects\n",
    "* Keys of pre-defined control-parameters are exported as static attributes of classes that follow the naming\n",
    "  scheme *CDPL.<PN>.ControlParameter* (<PN> = *CDPL* sub-package name, example: `CDPL.Chem.ControlParameter`_)\n",
    "* Four convenience functions are provided for each control-parameter introduced by a package\n",
    "\n",
    "*CDPL* classes employing the control-parameter infrastructure (directly or indirectly) are derived from class\n",
    "`CDPL.Base.ControlParameterContainer`_. The class provides methods which are similar to those found in \n",
    "`CDPL.Base.PropertyContainer`_ but also offers methods (`setParent()`_ and `getParent()`_) that allow to connect\n",
    "`CDPL.Base.ControlParameterContainer`_ instances in a parent-child manner. This way tree-like hierarchies of \n",
    "`CDPL.Base.ControlParameterContainer`_ instances for resolving parameter value requests can be built. \n",
    "If a requested parameter value is not stored in a given container, the request gets automatically forwarded to the\n",
    "registered parent container which may again forward the request to its parent until a value is found or the root of\n",
    "the tree has been reached. Furthermore, methods are provided which allow the registration of user-defined functions\n",
    "or function objects that get called on events such as parameter value change (methods \n",
    "`registerParameterChangedCallback()`_ and `unregisterParameterChangedCallback()`_), parameter value removal \n",
    "(methods `registerParameterRemovedCallback()`_ and `unregisterParameterRemovedCallback()`_) and parent change \n",
    "(methods `registerParentChangedCallback()`_ and `unregisterParentChangedCallback()`_).\n",
    "\n",
    "A notable difference between dynamic properties and control-parameters is that the latter always possess a default value which gets returned by the associated getter function if a parameter value has not been explicitly set. \n",
    "Control-parameter default values are exported and accessible as static attributes of classes that follow the \n",
    "naming scheme *CDPL.<PN>.ControlParameterDefault* (*<PN>* = *CDPL* sub-package name; example: \n",
    "`CDPL.Chem.ControlParameterDefault`_). \n",
    "\n",
    "Data I/O Framework\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes implementing the input/output of data of a certain type in a particular format (e.g. molecular structures in SD-file format) are derived from abstract base classes that follow the naming scheme \n",
    "*CDPL.<PN>.<DT>ReaderBase* and  *CDPL.<PN>.<DT>WriterBase*, respectively. *<PN>* denotes the *CDPL* sub-package\n",
    "name and *<DT>* is the name of the data type to read or write (e.g. classes `CDPL.Chem.MoleculeReaderBase`_ and\n",
    "`CDPL.Chem.MolecularGraphWriterBase`_).\n",
    "These base classes are all derived from the abstract class `CDPL.Base.DataIOBase`_ which itself is derived from `CDPL.Base.ControlParameterContainer`_. Instances of concrete classes implementing the I/O of data in a particular  format thus support the configuration of their runtime behavior by control-parameters (see \n",
    "`CDPL.Chem.ControlParameter`_ for examples). The names of the format-specific classes all follow the scheme \n",
    "*CDPL.<PN>.<FID><DT>Reader* and *CDPL.<PN>.<FID><DT>Writer*, respectively where *<PN>* denotes the *CDPL* sub-package name, *<FID>* is a format identifier (usually a characteristic file extension) and *<DT>* is the name of \n",
    "the data type to read or write (e.g. `CDPL.Chem.SDFMoleculeReader`_ and `CDPL.Chem.SDFMolecularGraphWriter`_). \n",
    "\n",
    "Data reader classes all expect an instance of class `CDPL.Base.IStream`_ and data writer classes an instance of `CDPL.Base.OStream`_ as argument to their constructor. \n",
    "These stream-based I/O classes represent abstract storage devices which allow the same code to handle I/O to files, in-memory strings, or custom adaptor devices that perform arbitrary operations (e.g. compression) on the fly.\n",
    "Concrete types of storage devices are implemented by dedicated subclasses of `CDPL.Base.IStream`_ and `CDPL.Base.OStream`_  such as class `CDPL.Base.FileIOStream`_ for file I/O and `CDPL.Base.StringIOStream`_ for in-memory string data I/O, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since files represent the most dealt-with kind of data storage, file I/O-specific variants of reader/writer classes \n",
    "are provided that make reading/writing data from/to files more convenient. These classes follow the naming scheme \n",
    "*CDPL.<PN>.File<FID><DT>Reader* and *CDPL.<PN>.File<FID><DT>Writer* (for the meaning of *<PN>*, *<FID>* and \n",
    "*<DT>* see text above). Instead of an instance of `CDPL.Base.IStream`_/`CDPL.Base.OStream`_ they accept the path \n",
    "to a file as constructor argument and thus circumvent the need to explicitly create and manage instances of class \n",
    "`CDPL.Base.FileIOStream`_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data format implemented by the *CDPL* is described by an instance of class `CDPL.Base.DataFormat`_ which\n",
    "stores and gives access to relevant format-specific information such as common file-extensions or mime-type. \n",

    "*CDPL.<PN>.DataFormat* where *<PN>* is the name of the *CDPL* sub-package implementing the format (e.g. `CDPL.Chem.DataFormat`_).\n",
    "\n",
    "The link between a `CDPL.Base.DataFormat`_ instance describing a particular data format and associated classes implementing the reading/writing of data in this format gets established by dedicated input- and output-handler classes. These classes provide factory methods to create a reader/writer class instance for a given file path or `CDPL.Base.IStream`_/`CDPL.Base.OStream`_ instance and follow the naming scheme \n",
    "*CDPL.<PN>.<FID><DT>InputHandler* and *CDPL.<PN>.<FID><DT>OutputHandler*, respectively (for the meaning of *<PN>*, \n",
    "*<FID>* and *<DT>* see text above; examples: `CDPL.Chem.SDFMoleculeInputHandler`_, \n",

    "`CDPL.Chem.MoleculeIOManager`_). Amongst others, the I/O manager classes provide methods to lookup a registered handler instance for a given file extension, mime-type or `CDPL.Base.DataFormat`_ object. This way it is possible to, e.g., write code that creates a reader class instance for the input of data from a file where the actual data format is determined lateron at runtime.  \n",
    "In order to facilitate the writing of data format-independent code the *CDPL* provides special reader and writer classes that perform the runtime lookup of a suitable input/output handler and reader/writer class \n",

The constructors of the classes expect the data source/sink to be provided as a `CDPL.Base.IStream`_/`CDPL.Base.OStream`_ instance or specified as path to a file.
